All of this has a condemning nature to it in my world. In a way, I start beating myself up about why we can’t do those things yet.

In reality, I’m certain what we have right now on our acreage is more than the overwhelming majority of the populace even a hundred years go. Potentially even today.

I have no idea where he was at in life at that point and what things were like in practicality for him. Was he just very disciplined? Was he mad? Was he truly still joyful? It seems a mix of all of it can be found. What do we take of it? God was proud of him the whole time. He knew Job would stick through it. This is a characteristic that’s hard to find.

Nope. I don’t have many friends. I’m an introvert by nature, so it’s much easier for me to hole up and enjoy a night in. I put a ton of mental energy into how to make the next move in business.
