Tools like <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">sed</code>, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">awk</code>, <code class=\\\"language-text\\\">grep</code>. Though I always told myself I'd someday practice them, I never really got around to it. Situations commonly come up that I know there's a good UNIX tool for, but I instead stick to what I am comfortable with. A concrete example of this is finding a file. Rather than using a cli tool, I'd instead open up (yes, I said open up) a JetBrains product and perform a file search for the file I wanted to make a quick edit on. Clearly this is slower.
