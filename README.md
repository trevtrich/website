This is my personal dumping ground for anything I'm learning about, looking into, or just wanting to store somewhere. 

The project started out based on [`gatstrap`](https://github.com/jaxx2104/gatsby-starter-bootstrap) from quite some time ago (and still has clear resemblence). After coming back to the project this week and having everything broken, decided I wanted to cut it down to bare bones and start nearly from scratch so I know what's going on and can fix it. I'm greatful the project got me on my feet, but now I know enough in the JS/React/Gatsby/GraphQL world that I'd rather not have any magic unless I'm to blame for it! :)
