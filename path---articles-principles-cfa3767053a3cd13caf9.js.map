While other funds were losing money like mad in the market crash in the first decade of the 2000s, Dalio landed his investors more than a 10％ return in the same time period.

These cards are used to get employees on the same page for example during a meeting. You sit down with a group you’re not entirely familiar with, look at everyone’s baseball cards and you know who you’re working with from the outset. If a decision is to be made and folks are struggling to settle on a decision, those that are the most believable are left to make the decision.</p>\\n<h1>Believability</h1>\\n<p>Believability is a core concept Dalio brings up many times throughout the book. Those that are believable are those that have proven success through experience and or backing from the people around them. Believability has nothing to do with seniority or years of experience, rather purely those things that should lead to the person with the best experience and track record being given the right to make the decision.</p>\\n<h1>“Managing” Yourself</h1>\\n<p>Dalio suggests that we all should view ourselves as a machine that we are tasked with managing to complete a goal. That is, you need to take yourself out of your own body and “use” your abilities / relationships as if you were your own manager. I thought this was really interesting and wise. Too often we take the day to day as it comes. A lot of times we get caught into the flow of life and forget that we have goals we want to achieve, and that by “flowing” we aren’t always (read rarely) headed in the best direction to achieve said goals. This is a nice challenge to take on.</p>\\n<h1>Staying in Sync</h1>\\n<p>You know those times when you have something you’d like to inform a co-worker about, but you think it might hurt their feelings, embarrass them, or even get them in trouble? This is a concept discussed as “getting in sync”. Bridgewater strives for openness, honesty, and healthy debate / disagreement. They have taken this to such an extent that if it is found out that you are witholding info like this from someone, there may be negative consequences. Said a different way, if you leave a meeting and think that someone said something unproductive or wrong, if you don’t inform them of that and someone finds out about it, you may be fired. This is where they get the “cultish” feel that people talk about. Whoof, this one makes me uncomfortable. I know this is valuable, but this fights my nature to avoid conflict and making someone feel bad at all cost. It’s important to note that they are very open and clear to new employees about this. That if you don’t agree or are not on board with this, you aren’t fit for the company. It’s easier when everyone is expecting it, but they do report that a healthy percentage of new hires still don’t make it past 1.5 years because they simply can’t get used to this practice. I can certainly see why. It would be an interesting environment, though, and I think we could all use to be a bit more open and honest with people as long as we have the right intentions in helping out our teams.</p>\\n<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>\\n<p>I wouldn’t want my children spending too much time around him, but Dalio has some great career perspective and has a very proven track record. If you come from a Christian belief system, keep your eyes open as you read through this. Dalio is not yet a God fearing man, and this shows; so don’t check your logical mind at the door and blindly listen to what’s being said. That said, there’s some gold in here.
